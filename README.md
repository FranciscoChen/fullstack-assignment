# Planet backend-assignment
Backend position skill assessment home assignment.

## Overview
This repository holds the basic project structure for implementing a NodeJS based API and service
used in a fictitious software solution that provides scrapping services.

Disclaimer: The purpose and usage of this repo is solely for insight adquisition regarding problem-solving,
and does not represent an existing and ongoing implementation task.

PD: We provide this structure as an starting point but you may discard it and approach the task in
any other way.

## Solution evaluation
We are in search for a backend developer who is capable of implementing API requirements, can work
databases and can design "future-proof" (if that trully exists) solutions.

Therefore we will evaluate the assignment:
- Home assignment completition: Whether you completed all tasks and how you prioritized time.
- Code versioning: We are not too picky regarding Git, but do appreciate feature branchs and a clean
  repo history that could help us understand how you approached this assignment.
- Task-specific implementation details:
  - ...
- Extras: Providing extra documentation, identifying any improvement opportunity (even if you didn't
  implement it), or having a fluent communication during your process (just let us know how you are
  doing) will be positively taken into account.
